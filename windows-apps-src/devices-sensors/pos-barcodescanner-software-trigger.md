# Use a software trigger

It can be useful to control the act of scanning from software if you are using a barcode scanner in presentation mode or if the scanner does not have a physical trigger such as a camera-based barcode scanner. You can initiate the scan process by calling [StartSoftwareTriggerAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.startsoftwaretriggerasync#Windows_Devices_PointOfService_ClaimedBarcodeScanner_StartSoftwareTriggerAsync).

Depending on the value of [IsDisabledOnDataReceived](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.isdisabledondatareceived#Windows_Devices_PointOfService_ClaimedBarcodeScanner_IsDisabledOnDataReceived) the scanner may scan only one barcode then stop or scan continuously until you call 
[StopSoftwareTriggerAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.stopsoftwaretriggerasync#Windows_Devices_PointOfService_ClaimedBarcodeScanner_StopSoftwareTriggerAsync).

Set the desired value of [IsDisabledOnDataReceived](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.claimedbarcodescanner.isdisabledondatareceived#Windows_Devices_PointOfService_ClaimedBarcodeScanner_IsDisabledOnDataReceived) to control the scanner behavior when a barcode is decoded.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| True   | Scan only one barcode then stop |
| False  | Continuously scan barcodes without stopping |


> [!Important]
> Confirm that your barcode scanner supports the use of software trigger by first checking the property [IsSoftwareTriggerSupported](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.devices.pointofservice.barcodescannercapabilities.issoftwaretriggersupported#Windows_Devices_PointOfService_BarcodeScannerCapabilities_IsSoftwareTriggerSupported).

The following example shows how to initiate scanning using a software trigger, which will stop scanning once it scans one barcode:

```cs
private void SoftwareTrigger(BarcodeScanner barcodeScanner, ClaimedBarcodeScanner claimedBarcodeScanner) 
{
    if (barcodeScanner.Capabilities.IsSoftwareTriggerSupported)
    {
        claimedBarcodeScanner.IsDisabledOnDataReceived = true;
        await claimedBarcodeScanner.StartSoftwareTriggerAsync();
    }
}
```
